# Words from translator
CS231n is a great compute vision lecture for beginners. I hope more people can benifit from this lecture, therefore, I am going to translate it into Chinese. This translation is my personal behavior. If it violates any copyright, acknowledge me and I will delete this repo immediately. 

If you find some paragraph inconsistent or unreasonable, it is very possible that I made a mistake. If you notice any of those, please indicate it out in issues. And better translation advice is always welcome.

# 来自译者的话
CS231n是一门非常适合入门者的计算机视觉课程。我计划把这门课的课件翻译至中文，以便于让更多人来学习。此举纯粹是个人行为，如果侵犯了任何版权，请告知我，我将会在第一时间删除。

如果你发现有段落逻辑不顺或是有违和之处，那很有可能是我翻译有误，请在issue中告知，同时欢迎任何翻译上的建议。
